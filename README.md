## 🏷️ Project Title
**Decentralized Academic Transcript Repository**

---

## 📄 Project Description

A blockchain-based platform that enables students to securely store and share verified academic transcripts across educational institutions and employers globally. By leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, the system ensures authenticity, prevents tampering, and eliminates the dependency on centralized academic databases.

The smart contract is deployed on the CoreDAO blockchain to utilize its scalability, low transaction costs, and decentralized security model.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to revolutionize the way academic credentials are stored and verified by:

- Empowering students with ownership of their academic records.
- Allowing institutions to issue verifiable transcripts securely on-chain.
- Reducing administrative overhead and fraud related to certificate issuance and verification.
- Promoting a globally trusted and interoperable educational credentialing system.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

The project sets the foundation for a global decentralized academic credentials network. In the future, it may expand to include:

- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving transcript sharing.
- Tokenized certifications and badges (NFTs) for skills and micro-credentials.
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) standards.
- A student-focused frontend dApp with verifiable sharing options.
- Employer verification portals.
